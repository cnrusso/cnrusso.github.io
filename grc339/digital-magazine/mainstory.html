                      <h2>Mella Giorno: The Art of Pasta-Making</h2>
                      <p>
                        By chance if you’d like to learn how to make fresh pasta from scratch, you can always find an online tutorial and follow the ad-filled recipe.
                        Or, if you have the means, you could go to historic Bari, Italy, a port city on the Adriatic Sea, and find out how it’s really done. Who better 
                        to teach you than some real-life, Italian “nonnas” (grandmas). Their old pasta-making techniques have been passed down through very many 
                        generations and perfected over lifetimes of practice. In fact, it’s older than the alleyway where they set up their shop. Along this very old, 
                        cobblestone street (officially called Strada Arco Basso but it is also nicknamed the one Via delle Orecchiette), about a dozen grandmas sit at 
                        long, wooden tables outside their niche ground-floor southern-Italian kitchens. Passersby are often taken aback by the high speed and technical 
                        craftsmanship of the ladies, who evenly roll out dough, cut bite-sized pieces and use a knife and their own fingers to create the tiny “ears” on the sides. 
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        According to Your Travel to Italy With Ana Patricia, a bag of the nonnas’ pasta makes for an excellent Italy souvenir, since after the nonnas dry 
                        it—for a few hours or overnight, depending on the outside conditions—it becomes easy to travel with and doesn’t spoil easily. And you can still 
                        see the difference fresh pasta makes when you get it home and cook it. “This is our workshop, our space, our everything.” Nonna Mella Giorno told 
                        Avanti Magazine about their worktables, which are lined right in front of their quaint homes. 
                      </p>

                      <p>“By the road, see. One step and we’re outside, one 
                        step and we’re inside. This is an art that does not have to be put aside. Rather, it was gifted to us, and we have to look after it and pass it down.” 
                        On the one hand, the pasta-making process seems quite simple.  “There is no salt,” Giorno remarked. “There are no eggs. It’s only kneading and elbow 
                        grease. This is homemade Italian pasta.” But when asked for the exact specifications of how much semolina flour and water to use, Giorno doesn’t give 
                        an apparent answer. The nonnas just know how. “Whatever works,” she replied. “I could never give you a precise calculation.” The art and tradition of 
                        pasta making has no one right way.</p>

                      <p>
                        But while the process might look intuitive to the nonnas, it comes from years—often decades—of practice. Many of them started as little girls, watching 
                        their mothers and grandmothers work the dough with practiced hands in the early morning light. It’s a rhythm passed down more through feeling than 
                        instruction, shaped by climate, experience, and the instinctive wisdom that comes from repetition. Each batch of dough is subtly different, depending 
                        on the humidity in the air or the flour available that day.

                        <p>
                        The nonnas don’t just make pasta—they create community. As they work, they chat among themselves, greet neighbors, and invite curious onlookers to 
                        watch. Tourists are welcomed with warm smiles and maybe even a quick lesson, though it’s clear this is not a performance for show, but a living 
                        tradition. The sound of knives tapping against the wooden boards, the laughter echoing off stone walls, and the scent of drying pasta combine into an 
                        experience that feels both timeless and intimate.</p>
                       <p>
                        And while the world modernizes around them, the nonnas’ practice remains largely unchanged. There’s a pride in their craft, a resistance to 
                        convenience, and a deep reverence for doing things slowly and well. In a world of fast food and instant recipes, their presence on Via delle 
                        Orecchiette is a quiet declaration: that some things—especially the things that feed us—are worth the time.</p>
