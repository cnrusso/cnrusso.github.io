                                In the winding alleys of southern Italy, Mella Giorno has turned pasta-making into a living, breathing art form. With practiced hands and flour-dusted aprons, artisans 
                                shape orecchiette and tagliatelle on wooden boards right on the street. Locals pause to chat, tourists gather to film, and the scent of semolina and olive oil fills the 
                                air. This isn’t just food preparation—it’s a celebration of heritage, rhythm, and community. In a world that moves fast, Mella invites us to slow down and savor handmade tradition.
